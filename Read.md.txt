Classification of Garbage Through Transfer Learning Using a Pre-trained Inception ResNet V2: 
This work proposes a Inception ResNet V2 which through transfer learning. 
InceptionResNetV2 is a convolutional neural network that is 164 layers deep, trained on millions of images from the ImageNet database, and can classify images into more than 1000 categories such as flowers, animals, etc.
The network learns the relevant features for classification which becomes particularly important since it is not always easy to understand which features should be extracted using traditional methods.

Classification of Garbage Using Convolutional neural networks(CNN) :
Convolutional neural networks is commonly used models in deep learning. 
Among different type of models, Convolutional neural networks has been demonstrated high performance on image classification.
Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) have intimated high performance on image classification which are made out of various handling layers
to gain proficiency with the portrayals of information with numerous unique levels.
